###Calculate the amount of meat and drink at a family or friends barbecue

#How it is calculated?
The calculation is based on the amount that a man, woman and child eat and drink.

Usually:
##Eat
**A man eat 400g and after 6 hours 600g**
**A woman eat 300g and after 6 hours 500g**
**A child eat 200g and after 6 hours 400g**

##Drink
**A man drink 1200ml and after 6 hours 2000ml**
**A woman drink 1000ml and after 6 hours 1800ml**
**A child drink 600ml and after 6 hours 1200ml**

Therefore, the number of men / women / children is multiplied by the amount they will eat based on the duration of the barbecue.

##I accept suggestions, criticisms and compliments
