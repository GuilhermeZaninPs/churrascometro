### Calculate the amount of meat and drink at a family or friends barbecue </br>

# How it is calculated? </br>
The calculation is based on the amount that a man, woman and child eat and drink. </br>

Usually: </br>
## Eat </br>
**A man eat 400g and after 6 hours 600g** </br>
**A woman eat 300g and after 6 hours 500g** </br>
**A child eat 200g and after 6 hours 400g** </br>

## Drink </br>
**A man drink 1200ml and after 6 hours 2000ml** </br>
**A woman drink 1000ml and after 6 hours 1800ml** </br>
**A child drink 600ml and after 6 hours 1200ml** </br>

Therefore, the number of men / women / children is multiplied by the amount they will eat based on the duration of the barbecue. </br>
 
## I accept suggestions, criticisms and compliments </br>
